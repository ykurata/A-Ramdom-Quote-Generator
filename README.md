# A Random Quote Generator

## Requirements

In this project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc..


## Project Instruction

### Create an array of objects to hold the data for your quotes.

* In your JavaScript file, start by creating the array of quote objects. Be sure to use the name quotes when creating the variable that holds the array of quote objects.

* The quotes array should be accessible in what's called "the global scope", which basically just means that it's not contained within a function.


### Add properties to the quote objects.

* Each quote object in the quotes array should have the following properties:

  * quote - a string containing the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.
  * source - a string containing the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" or "Traditional Irish proverb‚Äù or "Anonymous".
  * citation - optional - a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech, publication or a movie. If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.
  * year - optional - a number identifying the year of the quote. If there is no known year, then do not include this property on the object.

### Create the getRandomQuote function.

### Create the printQuote function.

### Add code comments.
